### Who are [Women Hack For Non-Profits](http://www.womenhackfornonprofits.com/)
Women Hack for Non-Profits matchmakes skilled women in technology to open source projects for non-profits, charities and individuals with a good social cause. By doing so, we aim to enhance the skill set of Women in Tech to support their growth and increase their footprint in the open source community.

### How can I contribute?
We have open issues that need resolving. Take a look and if one of them tickles your fancy drop the website maintainers a message in slack to let us know you are going to work on it and then assign the issue to yourself.

### How do I access the code?
All the instructions on getting this repository onto your local machine can be found in our [README.md](https://github.com/womenhackfornonprofits/whfnp/blob/dev/README.md). Once the project is on your machine branch off our `dev` branch and name your branch the issue number you are working on.

`git checkout -b <branchname>`

You'll make all your changes on your new branch.
