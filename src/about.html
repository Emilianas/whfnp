			<p class="col-xs-12">>Women Hack for Non Profits (WHFNP) is a community run by women for women to get more ladies into coding and contributing to Open Source projects. By volunteering with Women Hack for Non-Profits, women can practice and grow the skills they require to help switch careers into the engineering sector, while working on real life projects and communicating with clients. As a group we help each other grow, boost self-confidence, share and exchange experiences, knowledge and best practices, and provide guidance at all levels.</p>
			<p>We are over 300 on Slack and over 1000 on Meetup. Volunteers are a mixture of coders, designers, writers, project managers and testers working on projects that are personally rewarding and contribute to the society at large. Want a chance to work on real projects for non-profits and charities? Join us!</p>

		<h2 class="section-heading">Our Founding Team</h2>
		<p class="col-xs-12">Established in 2015 Women Hack For Non-Profits (WHFNP) is a fast growing community of women that are looking to improve their coding, testing or design skills. What started out as a simple idea back in May 2015 by co-founders Nandhini Narasimhan and Vinita Rathi has been brought to life and grown to the wonderful community we have today.</p>

			<p class="col-xs-12">Organised by the volunteer board members of the group we have monthly workshops, talks, panels and project hack evenings. We have just begun work on two more projects, which brings us up to 10 ongoing projects to this day. None of this would be possible without the hard work of the volunteer board members.</p>
