        <h2 class="section-heading">Non-Profits: Frequently Aasked Question</h2>
        <h3>1. When will development on my project begin and finish? We would like to go live in 3 months. Is that possible?</h3>
        <p>We cannot commit on a timeline and it is very difficult to estimate or have a end time estimate upfront because most of the volunteers undertake this work along with their full time job. We advise that this is decided after you have sat with volunteers, discussed scope of work.</p>
        <h3>2. Will you be able to do SEO, Social Marketing for us? </h3>
        <p>We might be able to help decide on the social media strategy but this is not something we specialise in. Most of us are developers, UI/UX specialists and Quality Engineers. </p>
        <h3>3. I have a very good idea that can change the world but I don’t know where to begin. Can I come and present my thoughts? Do I need to have technical spec prepared before pitching? </h3>
        <p>Yes, after you submit the form, we will then contact you asking for more details about the project. You will need to have scope/details of the project in writing that you would like to pitch before volunteers. Once we run this via our group internally, we will then contact you and arrange for you to come and present to one of our meetup. We will then run call for volunteers internally. Within 2-4 weeks, we will be able to connect you with volunteers who have expressed interest in working on the project. However, this is totally dependent on volunteers.</p>
        <h3>4. Can I get access to Slack which is where I was told all the volunteers communicate?</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately No. We use Slack to communicate amongst ourselves. Sometimes conversation there can be confidential. </p>
        <h3>5. What are WHFNP terms and conditions? </h3>
        <p>That the code produced by WHFNP volunteers is open source. That the web/mobile applications have mention of WHFNP (please ask us for media kit). That we and our volunteers are respected for the contribution they are making and treated fairly. </p>
        <h3>6. Do we have to pay for the services? </h3>
        <p>We are volunteering our time free of cost to help charities world wide overcome their technology challenges/barriers. Which means that even though we are not charging for our services at this point of time, we do expect that charities treats us with respect and abide to terms and conditions mentioned above. </p>
