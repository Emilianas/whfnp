						<h3>Wordpress</h3>
						<p>A new page on our wordpress website where we can display members of our charity's new membership scheme. We would like this to be formatted so we can have a short text introduction, followed by a section where we can display the logos of our members. When a visitor hovers the mouse over a logo, we would like a short description of the member to appear as well as a link to their website. A database (e.g. in MS Access) where we can store members' data, which we can edit and search for information in easily.</p>

						<h3>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Play, AWS, Sketch</h3>
						<p>When Susan’s sister Jaspal contracted Motor Neurone Disease, one of the hardest things was when Jaspal lost her voice to the disease. However Jaspal found innovative ways of communicating despite the condition. </p>
						<p>The charity aims to collate and review communication devices for those suffering from MND. We aim to have a catalogue of devices with user-generated reviews and tips. We hope to be able to donate devices to those in need.</p>

						<h3> Express, CartoDb, Leaflet, ejs, jQuery</h3>
						<p>This project is aiming to improve transparency around oil contracts. For that, we are building a website using NodeJS/Express on the backend and JavaScript on the front end. We are keeping the data on CartoDB, which includes a PostGIS database on the cloud and some data manipulation and analysis tools. We also use LeafLet, which is a JavaScript framework to plot the CartoDB data on a map. We have currently reached our first milestone and work is still on going.

						<h3>HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Grunt, AWS</h3>
						<p>We made a complete overhaul to our original static website, from its look to architecture. A simple-to-navigate, responsive and aesthetic user experience was at the forefront of the design, collaborated by a talented team of UX researchers and frontend designers (both experienced and new to the field).  The build made use of both our favourite tools and tech we’ve been meaning to try for a while: HTML5, SASS, Gulp, mongo.db, nodeJS, meteor and react.</p>

						<h2 class="section-heading">Ndifuna Ukuwazi</h2>
						<p>This project is based on Open Data Census platform which uses Node.js and Postgresql. It was launched with a basic set of features a few weeks ago.One of the requirements is to find a way to visualize the existing data. An idea of visually representing the existing data so it will be easier/quickly to understand . A library that can be used to create heat maps or charts.We need to write code in order to get the needed data from the database.</p>
