                fundamental diseases community to drive research and
                develop treatments.</p>
                <p>WHFNP volunteers built a new page on Findacure's
                Wordpress website to display members of the
                organization's new membership scheme. The page was
                formatted to include each member's bio, logo, and link
                back to their website. Volunteers also created a
                database and the ability to store, update, and search
                membership data.</p><a class="larger-button button"

                <p>We are currently working on powering it by a custom CMS
                and as a future phase, integrate it with an API that
                provides data surrounding our volunteers and
                non-profits.</p><a class="larger-button button" href=
