      <p class="volunteer-quote">"I joined WHFNP because I was interested in all of the things they do: women in tech, hacking, skills improvement and helping non-profits. I loved it from the first meeting. I always knew taking on a project is one of the best ways to improve your skills and it’s much more fun to do it with lots of other interesting people and a valuable cause" </p>
