					<h2 class="section-heading">Volunteers: Frequently Aasked Question</h2>
					<h3>1. How much time should I dedicate?</h3>
					<p>We understand that our volunteers are contributing their spare time and that lives can get busy. Any time you can dedicate, whether it be a couple of hours or a couple of days a week, will be beneficial and highly appreciated. Commitment differs between projects, teams and skillsets, so have a chat with us to see where you’d best fit.</p>

					<h3>2. Is this program restricted to only women?</h3>
					<p> The primary aim of our mission statement is to provide a supportive, safe and encouraging environment for women in tech to increase their contribution to the open source community. The reality of the gender gap in tech means women are a drastic minority and there are many cases in the workplace where women feel intimidated by a male-dominated environment and do not build the confidence to step up and excel in their careers. </p>

					<p>For this reason, we prefer to provide that safe space and have WHFNP project teams consist of women only unless collaborating with our partnering organizations’ mixed-gender tech teams.</p>

					<p>Nevertheless, we have many male supporters and anyone is welcome to participate in promoting and assisting the organisation’s growth in other ways, e.g. organising meetups, conducting workshops, volunteer outreach, partner outreach etc.</p>

					<h3>3. What other things I can be involved other than coding?</h3>
					<p> There are many aspects to delivering projects aside from coding. If you are new to tech, you’ll be surprised by how handy the skills you already know can come in to get a project out the door. Additionally, we provide our volunteers with resources and events to learn coding if they are interested. Here are just a few other ways you can volunteer: </p>

					<ul>
						<li><p>Design/writing/creative skills</p></li>
						<li><p>Project management</p></li>
						<li><p>Quality Assurance/Testing</p></li>
						<li><p>PR/social media expertise</p></li>
						<li><p>Reaching out to volunteer orgs/partners</p></li>
						<li><p>Helping us find hosts for our regular meetups</p></li>
						<li><p>Helping us find and organise hackathons, workshops and other tech events</p></li>
						<li><p>Teaching workshops</p></li>
						<li><p>Consultation, advice on expansion, growth strategy, etc</p></li>
					</ul>


					<h3>4. How do I get started on a project? </h3>
					<p>Once you sign up using this form , we will email you on how to get started. Once you’re all set up, you can browse through the projects and keep an eye on their progress via slack channels, JIRA and other comms. If you find a project you’d like to actively get involved in, get in touch with the Project Manager for that team. This can be done by introducing yourself in the project team’s slack channel or contacting us directly by email to discuss your interest.</p>

					<h3>5. I’m new to coding/technology or returning after a long time - can I still join this group?</h3>
					<p>Yes, of course! One of our key goals is to aid the development of coding and technical skills within WHFNP. We have built a community that prides itself on supporting each other through sharing resources, providing workshops and simply helping each other out while we collaborate.  Choose your project, tell your team that you are a “newbie” or “rusty” (a lot of us are!) and they’ll be more than happy to help. All you need to join is a passion for technology, open source and making great projects happen.</p>
