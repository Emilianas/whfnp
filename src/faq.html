            <h2 class="section-heading">Volunteers: Frequently Asked Question</h2>
            <h3>1. How much time should I dedicate?</h3>
            <p>We understand that our volunteers are contributing their spare time and that lives can get busy. Any time you can dedicate, whether it be a couple of hours or a couple of days a week, will be beneficial and highly appreciated. Commitment differs between projects, teams and skillsets, so have a chat with us to see where you’d best fit.</p>

            <h3>2. Is this program restricted to only women?</h3>
            <p> The primary aim of our mission statement is to provide a supportive, safe and encouraging environment for women in tech to increase their contribution to the open source community. The reality of the gender gap in tech means women are a drastic minority and there are many cases in the workplace where women feel intimidated by a male-dominated environment and do not build the confidence to step up and excel in their careers. </p>

            <p>For this reason, we prefer to provide that safe space and have WHFNP project teams consist of women only unless collaborating with our partnering organizations’ mixed-gender tech teams.</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, we have many male supporters and anyone is welcome to participate in promoting and assisting the organisation’s growth in other ways, e.g. organising meetups, conducting workshops, volunteer outreach, partner outreach etc.</p>

            <h3>3. What other things I can be involved other than coding?</h3>
            <p> There are many aspects to delivering projects aside from coding. If you are new to tech, you’ll be surprised by how handy the skills you already know can come in to get a project out the door. Additionally, we provide our volunteers with resources and events to learn coding if they are interested. Here are just a few other ways you can volunteer:
                <ul>
                    <li>Design/writing/creative skills</li>
                    <li>Project management</li>
                    <li>Quality Assurance/Testing</li>
                    <li>PR/social media expertise</li>
                    <li>Reaching out to volunteer orgs/partners</li>
                    <li>Helping us find hosts for our regular meetups</li>
                    <li>Helping us find and organise hackathons, workshops and other tech events</li>
                    <li>Teaching workshops</li>
                    <li>Consultation, advice on expansion, growth strategy, etc</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>4. How do I get started on a project? </h3>
            <p>Once you sign up using this form , we will email you on how to get started. Once you’re all set up, you can browse through the projects and keep an eye on their progress via slack channels, JIRA and other comms. If you find a project you’d like to actively get involved in, get in touch with the Project Manager for that team. This can be done by introducing yourself in the project team’s slack channel or contacting us directly by email to discuss your interest.</p>

            <h3>5. I’m new to coding/technology or returning after a long time - can I still join this group?</h3>
            <p>Yes, of course! One of our key goals is to aid the development of coding and technical skills within WHFNP. We have built a community that prides itself on supporting each other through sharing resources, providing workshops and simply helping each other out while we collaborate. Choose your project, tell your team that you are a “newbie” or “rusty” (a lot of us are!) and they’ll be more than happy to help. All you need to join is a passion for technology, open source and making great projects happen.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Non Profits: Frequently Aasked Question</h2>
            <h3>1. When will development on my project begin and finish? We would like to go live in 3 months. Is that possible?</h3>
            <p>We cannot commit on a timeline and it is very difficult to estimate or have a end time estimate upfront because most of the volunteers undertake this work along with their full time job. We advise that this is decided after you have sat with volunteers, discussed scope of work.</p>
            <h3>2. Will you be able to do SEO, Social Marketing for us? </h3>
            <p>We might be able to help decide on the social media strategy but this is not something we specialise in. Most of us are developers, UI/UX specialists and Quality Engineers. </p>
            <h3>3. I have a very good idea that can change the world but I don’t know where to begin. Can I come and present my thoughts? Do I need to have technical spec prepared before pitching? </h3>
            <p>Yes, after you submit the form, we will then contact you asking for more details about the project. You will need to have scope/details of the project in writing that you would like to pitch before volunteers. Once we run this via our group internally, we will then contact you and arrange for you to come and present to one of our meetup. We will then run call for volunteers internally. Within 2-4 weeks, we will be able to connect you with volunteers who have expressed interest in working on the project. However, this is totally dependent on volunteers.</p>
            <h3>4. Can I get access to Slack which is where I was told all the volunteers communicate?</h3>
            <p>Unfortunately No. We use Slack to communicate amongst ourselves. Sometimes conversation there can be confidential. </p>
            <h3>5. What are WHFNP terms and conditions? </h3>
            <p>That the code produced by WHFNP volunteers is open source. That the web/mobile applications have mention of WHFNP (please ask us for media kit). That we and our volunteers are respected for the contribution they are making and treated fairly. </p>
            <h3>6. Do we have to pay for the services? </h3>
            <p>We are volunteering our time free of cost to help charities world wide overcome their technology challenges/barriers. Which means that even though we are not charging for our services at this point of time, we do expect that charities treats us with respect and abide to terms and conditions mentioned above. </p>
